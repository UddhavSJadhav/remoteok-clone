            Pricing of job posts and extra features is dynamic and may change
            based on how many jobs are posted every week, for example to avoid
            too many sticky jobs at one time. Sticky posts are limited to max 2
            per company at one time. Job posts are a) published for 30 days, b)
            cannot be refunded, and c) renew automatically after 30 days unless
            you 1) disable auto renew after posting on the edit page, or 2)
            close your job post on the edit page. We send a reminder 7 days by
            email before renewing. Renewing is the same price as the original
            job post for 30 days. If you buy a bundle, the discounted single job
            post price is used to renew. Automatic renewals can be self-refunded
            within 7 days after renewing with the link in the email.
